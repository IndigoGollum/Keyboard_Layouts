This is a collection of keyboard layouts i've made. They're sorted by what program they're for.

For Kanata: install Kanata (https://github.com/jtroo/kanata/), copy or download layout code into a file called kanata.kbd, run Kanata.

For Multiling O Keyboard: Install the thing (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=kl.ime.oh or
https://multiling-o-keyboard-emoji.en.softonic.com/android), set Multiling O as your keyboard, copy layout code from phone, use spacebar
to navigate to "Layouts...", click "[+ DIY]", click "Paste".

For XKB, i don't really remember. Sorry.
